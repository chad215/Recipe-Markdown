 <h1>pancake recipe </h1> 
<h2>Ingredient's:</h2>
<ol>1. 1/2 Cup of flour </ol>
<ol>2. 3 tablespoons sugar</ol>
<ol>3. 1 tablespoon baking powder</ol>
<ol>4. 1/4 teaspoon salt</ol>
<ol>5. 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg</ol>
<ol>6. 2 large eggs, at room temperature</ol>
<ol>7. 1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature</ol> 
<ol>8. 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</ol>
<ol>9. 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed</ol>
<h1>Directions:</h1>
<ol>1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.</ol>
<ol>2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.</ol>2. 
<ol>3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.</ol>
<ol>4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed.</ol>
<ol>5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter,adding more butter to the skillet as needed.</ol>
<ol>6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings</ol>
